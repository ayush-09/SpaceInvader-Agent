# SpaceInvader-Agent
It is the agent of SpaceInvaders-v0 based on **OpenAI Gym** environment with the implementation of DQN algorithm.
## OpenAI Gym
http://gym.openai.com/envs/SpaceInvaders-v0/<br>

OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. This is the gym open-source library, which gives you access to a standardized set of environments.

## Reinforcement Learning (DQN)
DQN is a reinforcement learning algorithm where a deep learning model is built to find the actions an agent can take at each state.<br>
DQN is a combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning. The model target is to approximate Q(s, a), and is updated through back propagation.
